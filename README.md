# Automatic-Image-Captioning
This Project is aimed at generation of descriptions from the image using multimodal neural networks and natural language process in recognizing. This model architecture recognizes the context of the image and describes them in nature language (here English)  The outcomes can be used in virtual assistants, image indexing, help visually impaired persons etc.

# Objective

***To build a Neural Network based model which can generate descriptions of the images in Natural Langauge (here English)***


<p align="justify">
Captioning the images with proper description is a popular research area of Artificial Intelligence. A good description of an image is often said as “Visualizing a picture in the mind”. The generation of descriptions from the image is a challenging task that can help and have a great impact in various applications such as usage in virtual assistants, image indexing, recommendation in editing applications, help visually impaired persons and several other natural language processing applications.

<p align="justify">
In this project, a multimodal neural network is created which involves the concept of computer vision and Natural Language Process in recognizing the context of images and describe them in natural languages (English, etc). Deploy the model and evaluate the model on 10 different real time images.
