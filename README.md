# Automatic-Image-Captioning
This Project is aimed at generation of descriptions from the image using multimodal neural networks and natural language process in recognizing. This model architecture recognizes the context of the image and describes them in nature language (here English)  The outcomes can be used in virtual assistants, image indexing, help visually impaired persons etc.
